##What It Is
---
A simple note taking application made using Node.js and Javacript. It is meant to be used via the command line 
to create, list, remove and read different notes you have saved. It was made with the intentions of reviewing Node.js basics.


##What Was Used

  * Javascript

##MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
---  
A simple application that can be used with the command line. You can create different notes, view all the names of your different notes,
Read a specific note and finally delete a specific note. It is very simple and doesnt have any sort of front end UI at this time, it was
created with Node.js in mind. I may come back to add a UI but that is a stretch goal.
